London Bike Rides Analysis

This project analyzes the London Bike Sharing dataset using Python and Tableau to explore trends in ride volume, weather patterns, and time-based usage behaviors.

Python Data Preparation
The Jupyter notebook (LondonBikes.ipynb) handles all preprocessing steps, including:

1. Importing and inspecting the raw dataset
2. Renaming and cleaning columns for clarity
3. Converting units (e.g., humidity to percentages)
4. Replacing numeric season codes with readable labels


Tableau Visualizations
The Tableau workbook (London Bike Rides Analysis.twbx) uses the cleaned dataset to visualize key insights across five worksheets:

Total Rides — Overall ride volume and high-level trends
Hour — Distribution of rides by hour of day
Heat Map — Pattern intensity across combined variables (e.g., time, season, or weather)
Moving Average — Smoothed trends over time using rolling calculations
Weather — Relationship between weather conditions and total rides

These visualizations highlight how time, seasonality, and weather influence London’s bike-sharing usage.
